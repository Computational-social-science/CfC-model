# Closed-form Continuous-time Neural Networks (CfCs)
Closed-form Continuous-time Neural Networks (CfCs) are powerful sequential liquid neural information processing units.

Paper Open Access: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00556-7

Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13898

# Neural Circuit Policies(NCPs)
Neural Circuit Policies are recurrent neural network models inspired by the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans.
The package currently provides two neuron models: LTC and CfC
